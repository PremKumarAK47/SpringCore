## Maven
</n>
Apache Maven is a build automation and project management tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps to manage dependencies, build and test your projects, and package and deploy them to various environments. Maven uses a declarative approach to define the build process, using an XML file called pom.xml (Project Object Model). It provides a standardized way to organize your project structure, and integrates with various IDEs and build tools to make development and deployment easier. Some key features of Maven include dependency management, build profiles, plugins, and a central repository for storing and sharing artifacts.
